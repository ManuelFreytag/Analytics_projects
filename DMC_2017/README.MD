# DMC 2017
This repository contains the most relevant scripts used in my approach to takle the DMC 2017.

**The report explains our procedure in detail.**

The folder structure containing all scripts is losely based on the CRISP modelling approach:
- Business understanding (can be found in the final report)
- Data exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Data modelling

The evaluation is included in the modelling scripts.


For the lack of repository space the original and final processed data can not be uploaded. (filesize > 300 MB)
The original data can be found here: https://www.data-mining-cup.com/reviews/dmc-2017/

Also, the preprocessing steps can take multiple hours as the dataset is very large.
